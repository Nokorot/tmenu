- the token separator ' ', should be possible to change with a flag

-  Allow for free writing

- Json Config file
- Json Source file

- !!! Really need to use a better data structure for StrList

Note:
If tmenu outputs the current content of the entry at each key press,
the list could be adjusted according to what is written. This could be
used for more advanced autocompletion.
    For example:  new with names like anything_%date,
    where anything_%date is added to the list when the % sign is added
In this case a clear signal might be useful and/or a (-r) remove pipe/file.

This would also requite, the input file to be read, on a different thread or
checked each time a character is entered.
# Alternatively:
    Generate, generate these inside tmenu.
    Some regex expression. ".*%{date, time, ...}"
    Would go well with json

# Needs to be done and Ideas

- Scroll

- Free writing result.
- Following multi select
        That is, the lines are push when selected and removed from the list.
        (Removing could also be an option, but then there most be some visual indication of what has been pushed).
        This allows the receiving program to act on the selected line in parallel.
        But deselecting lines makes no sense any more.

- Flag for commit/quit conformation
        convenient in the case of multi-select
- Redraw only what is necessary
- Handle changing terminal size
- Capture Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z
- Page up / Page Down, End / Home
- Vim keys (when holding Alt) / Emacs key
- Configuration file
- Capture Unicode chars



# Partly done
- Don't overflow the selection, i.e. move the selection when sel > #lines
- Colour flag: Needs some clean up

# Done:
- Prompt
- Multi select
- Flags,  ignore case
- Cursor selection. Up Down
- Cursor selection: Left right
