# Needs to be done and Ideas
- Following multi select
        That is, the lines are push when selected and removed from the list.
        (Removing could also be an option, but then there most be some virsual indication of what has been pushed).
        This allows the resiving program to act on the selected line in paralell. 
        But deselecting lines makes no sense anymore.

- Flag for conformation
        convinient in the case of multiselect
- Redraw only what is nessesary
- Handle changing terminal size
- Capture Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z
- Vim keys (when holding alt) / Emacs key
- Configuration file
- Capture Unicode chars

- Realy need to use a beter data structure for StrList


# Partaly done
- Dont overflow the selection, ie. move the selection when sel > #lines
- Color flag: Needs some clean up

# Done:

- Multi select
- Flags,  ignore case
