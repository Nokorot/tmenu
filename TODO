- !!! Realy need to use a beter data structure for StrList

Note:
If tmenu outputs the current content of the entry at each key press,
the list could be adjuted acording to what is written. This could be
used for more advanced autocompletion.
    For example:  new with names like anything_%date,
    where anythng_%date is added to the list when the % sign is added
In this case a clear signal might be usefull and/or a (-r) remove pipe/file.

This would also requite, the input file to be read, on a different thread or
checked each time a character is entered.


# Needs to be done and Ideas

- Scroll

- Free writing result.
- Following multi select
        That is, the lines are push when selected and removed from the list.
        (Removing could also be an option, but then there most be some virsual indication of what has been pushed).
        This allows the resiving program to act on the selected line in paralell.
        But deselecting lines makes no sense anymore.

- Flag for conformation
        convinient in the case of multiselect
- Redraw only what is nessesary
- Handle changing terminal size
- Capture Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z
- Page up / Page Down, End / Home
- Vim keys (when holding alt) / Emacs key
- Configuration file
- Capture Unicode chars



# Partaly done
- Dont overflow the selection, ie. move the selection when sel > #lines
- Color flag: Needs some clean up

# Done:
- Prompt
- Multi select
- Flags,  ignore case
- Cursor selection. Up Down
- Cursor selection: Left right
